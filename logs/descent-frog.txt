Quest 1: First Blood

Encounter 1: Two Goblin Archers got away. The Red Archer did decent
damage to Tarha. The Ettin did massive damage to Avric, but he healed
both of them on his turn and then scored a huge hit against the
Ettin. Then Tarha used two big attacks on Ettin and killed him. It was
over in about three rounds.

Quest 2: A Fat Goblin

Encounter 1: The Overlord got away with 3 Crops and the Heroes saved
1. The Goblins got two Crops right away on the second round and the
Heroes couldn't stop them, but manage to get 1. During the last few
rounds, the Heroes missed on every attack. But, in the very last
round, Grisban killed three monsters, including the last carrying a
crop, and used Advance to move forward, but the Spider was too close
to the exit, so on the next round a Goblin took it and ran.

Quest 2: A Fat Goblin

Encounter 2: The Overlord chose a Shadow Dragon for his Open Group. He
was able to pick up two prisoners in the first round with the Archers
and make a few attacks with his Spiders. He slowly moved the Dragon
forward which made the Heroes have to deal with him. The next round
Splig failed his interrogation check, even though the Overlord caught
a glimpse of the right token to interrogate first. The other Archers
made their way to the entrance. By this time, the heroes had beat most
of the Spiders and almost killed the Dragon with a lucky roll. Next,
they fought the Archers, who went down pretty easily. Splig got right
up next to them and they formed a wall on the next round and did some
damage. Unfortunately, Grisban had so much damage from the previous
encounter that when Splig got a good hit on his first action, he was
able to use his second to escape the map... and get a win!
